Agreed. Have experienced this $T$ with neuro Lyme prior to COVID. I've had stiff tight neck and back, pain like the spine is swollen inside, headache, light sensitivity, weird vision changes... that was with mild meningitis from Lyme. Can't tell COVID and Lyme apart.

No, it was an online form, and it was fairly simple as I haven't been anywhere! I think it may have come via A going to the Co-op. She had weird $T$ and stomach flu last week and looking back that was possibly Covid. But R&amp;W tested negative (tested because of Zoe app).

Generally I wake up and feel I can do anything, but then I crash, certainly by 3 PM.  I don't wake up fatigued, but I get there very fast, IMO.  But because I've done something in those 9 hours, I then call it tiredness, but maybe it was $T$ all along.

Not a good gauge at all: at least 50% of COVID patients never develop a $T$ as part of their symptoms. The thermometers may be good at excluding kids with the flu but not COVID!

But in vaxxed people the symptoms often aren't the main 3 (cough, fever, $T$) and  t.co/382WeLTuC6 uses these as the criteria for booking a PCR. So lateral flow with mild symptoms eg headache/cold type in vaxxed then follow up PCR if positive seems to be the guidance?

Do a lateral flow test just to be sure - lots of “$T$” turning out to be COVID. My sister a fortnight ago thought she just had a cold - but nope, it was COVID. My Dad then developed a cold which thankfully was just a cold. So hopefully it is just a cold! And get well soon!

No lanyard ≠ not exempt. Unless you think they should display their personal medical records. Being healthy and on a train is a good sign they don't have COVID but any particles big enough to be stopped by masks are equally stopped by covering nose/ mouth when coughing/ $T$

I disagree. You can’t fully blame those without the vaccine because those that got it can spread it just as easily and they were the ones out there $T$ without a mask the past few months. My vaccinated husband got covid with me and is the one that likely brought it home.

POTS is an orthostatic condition. Your heart tries to get the blood back to its core. Your HR laying down could be 75 when you stand it could jump to 160. This causes passing out, debilitating headaches, $T$, hot flashes, some people are so bad they become bed bound.

And this I think is why my other symptoms (headache, nausea, appetite issues, fatigue) have been “intermittent” and made me feel like I’m crazy. It’s also why I think my $T$ has been so bad after like...just sitting at my desk at work. Because it’s all related to my oxygen.

Because I had Covid, it caused fatigue, sore throat, light cough, chills. A $T$ that lasted a couple of seconds (I’m not exaggerating). Just plan to take it easy.  The symptoms hit me around 8 hours after the injection. You’ll feel elated after.
headache

$T$ can also cause headaches related to exercise (and often times anemia and dehydration are correlated), so another thing to consider is whether you’re getting adequate hydration (especially pre- &amp; post-exercise.)

Hugs. Thank you for understanding. Lack of sleep does impact mood so severely. It always has. I don't sleep more than about 6 1/2 hrs but I need to get that much to function well. Teariness hits quickly with $T$ and fatigue. I am glad I made it to my appt. today.

Then why do u think it's ok to infringe upon the rights of others? No scientific evidence that masks prevent or slow covid any more than covering ur $T$/cough, washing hands and stay distanced. If u think ur rights are 2b safe from disease that's ur responsibility not mine.
