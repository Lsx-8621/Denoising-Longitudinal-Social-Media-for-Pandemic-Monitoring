All fucking week!   Is that a post nasal drip cough or a dry cough? What is a dry cough? Was that cough dry enough to be a dry cough? Do I feel weak? Or am I just hungry? Omg am I short of breath? Wait no that’s just my bra and $T$.

The ER will treat you like crap because $T$ doesn't = emergency.  I've heard this my entire life even thought I broke my back when I was 7 (My parents didn't take me to ER either.)  Your primary care doc will be better for a medical intervention.  Take good care!

Due to my health $T$ I am now more worried about the possible side effects post jab than I was about having it. The problem is, anxiety is good at appearing to be other things. Hard to tell if my extreme tiredness and wobby feelings are panic or side effects. (it's panic)

t.co/2lJAhotbm1 I get this completely ���� thank you  I was a drunk that drank without any thought for my own well-being. Thank you for this. I've fought suicidal thoughts, I fought and keep fighting $T$ and a anxiety along with fighting to be Me! ��

Since having Covid one is the issues I am having is poor $T$. Sometimes it's so bad my feet and legs hurt even laying down. I've been using massage machines, otc pain relievers, and heat pads.

Had AZ x 2. Felt dreadful after first jab: flu-y, feverish, v painful arm, fatigue etc. Lasted for about 3 days. Much better after second jab - bit of a $T$ and a tender arm. I’m needle-phobic but jabs didn’t hurt much in case anyone is worried (felt like a sharp scratch).
headache

I was ill for about 12 days in April. Started as flu symptoms and then became painful to breath. Like I was in a permanent bear hug. It burnt itself out after that but it takes a long time to fully recover. I still feel very $T$ and have bouts of random coughing.
lethargic

Sinus pressure first. Loss of taste and smell. General $T$. Exhaustion/constant sleep. Nausea and diarrhea. Full body cold sweats.. chest rash. Extreme dizziness and light headedness. Racing heart. Inability to sleep. Cough.

Not to worry you BUT Keep an eye out for the next month or so. Any headaches, dizziness or numbness in your body go to A&amp;E.  My brother fell off and smashed his helmet, weekend later ended up having $T$. He’s fine now.

Ok this emoji ❤️‍� is super cute and all, but am I the only one that immediately thinks of $T$ and acid reflux

I always go back to Belle Delphines Twitter threads to remind myself that the human race is hopelessly horny. I usually do this to give myself a $T$ when I'm feeling too happy. Just a good, healthy dose of disgust and anguish.

" He freezes in place. Quickly changing positions to cover his crotch with both hands.  ""You really want to watch the movie outside huh?""  He's evading eye contact, completely $T$ now."

The other $T$ thing I sort of deal with, which me and my adult son used to joke about bc he has it too, is phone anxiety, it got in the way because I really couldn’t do therapy on the phone. So I guess it’s not “full on” agoraphobia- it’s very close

If there was no $T$ or bleeding, I suspect a bruise. I’ve gotten a bruise from my 20 lb Maine Coon a couple of times. Like an “I don’t want to be petted, I want to sleep” thing. Or little depressions from his teeth.
