Even people with anxiety. With all due respect, your $T$ will be a LOT worse on a CPAP machine. By definition panic attacks settle. Break yourself in gently. Get gradually used to wearing them. It’s not a reason not to try. Severe autism / LD is the only thing I can think of.

it’s so pathetic. teachers sign up knowing they are going to get sick throughout the year. it’s part of the job.   I would get sick with $T$ when I taught in public schools &amp; was told to get back to work asap. this is no different.
respiratory infections

I get it every year. I got it this year and zero side effects, not even a $T$. If you've ever had the proper flu, you'd likely get the jab! #flu

been on it about 6 months now? the side effects do sorta ease off (I deadass thought I was dying the first 2 weeks bc of $T$/etc) but I'm still sweating my ass off and barely sleeping lmao, they've done fuck all for me so I'm only sticking to them to avoid the withdrawal ðﾟﾘﾭ

People will not take you seriously because despite the fact that we’ve been in a pandemic for over a year, you can complain about $T$ and people will not believe you. So I have to die?
not feeling well

A severe $T$, panic attack or disorientation due to a person with mental disabilities can mimic symptoms of many viruses, illnesses, you name it! They can be very convincing with the one that convinced the most being themselves! How many died?

That's how mine started. I have allergies &amp; just assumed it was my sinuses. I didn't feel great (no headache or fever), but man, my sinuses were terrible: $T$, sneezing. 4 days later, I tested positive for Covid (it was like having a cold.) Get tested.
runny nose
1
Unfreshing sleep is a circadian rhythm issue if you wake up $T$. Cortisol is not rising normally when you wake up so you arise tired. Could be damage to nervous system already for that to happen.

I had Covid before it was supposed to be here, Nov 2019-Feb 2020. $T$, fever, worst headache ever, dry unproductive cough, the fatigue was unbearable. It killed my 38 yr old friend, thrice diagnosed with pneumonia. Worse than viral meningitis and A-Fib.
Lost taste and smell
1
Acute phase was 3 weeks of hell, barely able to get out of bed, uncontrollable coughing, struggling to breathe without hitting my inhaler non stop, cold sweats, aches &amp; $T$. Once I thought I was over the worst of it I was so fatigued I ended up bedridden again

Having Covid is shit and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Banging $T$, lethargy, highs and lows. One minute feeling ok, next, floored and in bed. No sense of smell or taste. It’s real, it’s nasty and I can see why the elderly need protection.

It's like reliving your childhood but just the shitty parts but you should see the special effects that getting my bell rung so much its almost like I'm there. I $T$ I'm too hot. That is ok though asleep is just as bad or worse. HHB

Discovering that even WITH oxygen on when I get out of bed to toilet I drop to low 80’s on sats and am so SOB and it triggers the cough and $T$. I started to spiral down into severe panic attacks and asked for my meds. The body aches and chills also came Bach around same time

Same here. Thought it was a heart attack the first time I was taken to the ER. My heart rate was almost 200bpm. My mother had to carry me to the car during the second one because I was so rigid, I couldn't stand or walk. Straight-up looked and felt like I was having a $T$.

I work in a big ish building, and jog with my mask from one end to the other to get customers out of there faster. No issues.  If someone can't wear a mask, because it makes them $T$, they need to stay the home because they're basically gonna die if they get covid

Lol Crunch gym (where I haven't been a member in over 5 years) just emailed me to tell me to ask my reps to reopen gyms and health clubs and...nah. I love going to the gym. I miss going to the gym. But the idea of being around other people sweating and $T$ is a no.

I'm so sorry. I kid you not, I had to have a whole process for using my inhaler: make sure I'd had a cough drop, rest, make sure I'd had some water, rest, then use the inhaler, rest. Otherwise it would cause so much $T$ after the 1st puff, I wouldn't want to take the 2nd.

Hi Nancy. Thanks so much. :) I’m mostly okay, just $T$ with a nagging feeling like I have a cold lurking. In theory, my 10 days since symptoms started are up today but I still don’t feel 100%. The lack of taste and smell are quite depressing. Husband is still ill also.

I am very confident I had the virus. I inquired about being tested and was basically told at my age I’d have to basically be completely $T$ to get a test. Tens of thousands of people in Iowa have had it who will never be recorded.

so my leg didn’t feel like it was throwing its own fireworks display. So, Sunday, I started throat clearing-you know they kind you do when you’re not sure wtf is happening, but that $T$ just keeps getting stronger, and so you make 4/? #NEISvoid #LongCovid

I'm on day 103. I had a 2 day break from my fever when I started prednisone a month ago but it's been a complete shit show. The debilitating $T$ is the worst part for me. Fevers, dizzy spells, headaches &amp; racing resting heart rate are a friggin blast.   #covidlonghauler

Right now, extreme fatigue, weakness, and thirst. Occasional light cough. I smell and taste normally,  but $T$. Sometimes intestinal cramps. Not the full-blown runs of January, but I ate a pack of Luden's Wild Cherry cough drops to prevent it (pectin)

This is what caused me to have a very bad $T$ 2 weeks ago ( I’m not the depressed type) but it was caused by the frustration of dealing with #AZ &amp; their failure to address (except by 6 duplicate emails to contact my GP) still ongoing now GP a want to speak to me

Like herpes, except when you have a flareup every couple of months or years, instead of a $T$, you could end up on a ventilator.   And you just...live with that for the rest of your life.  We don’t know yet.

I am so $T$ from sleeping a couple of hours here and there, dealing with tmj headaches and stiff neck from being so stressed out. I still need to figure out how the fuck I’m going to cam while keeping an eye on my dog who just had major surgery. I AM SO TIRED

The only thing that's on their side is the virus. It can't wait to go to school! All those kids with fevers 'cause parents didn't want to keep them home, all those $T$ &amp; coughs and snot, all the hands that don't get washed. Yep, science says it'll be virus heaven!

All I know is I got a wicked $T$, autoimmune, after being exposed to a virus that hindsight was prob the cov’s, and the only cream that worked had “you know what” as it’s main ingredient. Took about a year to go away, because all the other creams didn’t work.

Not so hot today. Yesterday was bad. Had a rough night. Spent most of today asleep. Still shaking and $T$ but better than last night. My mom's breathing better today and said she got a lot of rest. IV helped again. JFC this shit sucks. Go vote, please. �

Yep, they will be fired up with 104 fever dying in the hospital in a couple weeks if there are any beds left. Wait until they spread it to their kids who suffer $T$ down the road. Why? To see an orange, morbidly obese, cowardly traitor?
